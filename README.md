# Text Summarization using Word Frequency - NLP

Text summarization is a handy approach for extracting key information from a huge text content. This project utilises the sentence's word frequencies to provide a score for each sentence. It processed the text information with the Natural Language Toolkit and preprocessed the data with regular expressions. This is a simple text summarising approach for obtaining meaningful data.
